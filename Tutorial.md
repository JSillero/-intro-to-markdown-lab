# How to make he perfect sandwich
_Perfection_ might be the enemy of ___progress___, but while keeping that in mind we shall strive to get as close as we can with current technology and knowledge.

And thus this is a holistical guide to implement depending on your variable circumstances.

>There are many factors to maximice which are not always compatible nor considered in this order.

## Taste
Taste is complex, and may be subdivided in the following:
+ **Flavour**: mainly carried by oils and diluted by water.
+ **Aroma**: carried by volatile particles diluted in a variety of ways. Adds subtlety and variety.
+ **Texture**: the inmediate touch based feedback the food produces. 
+ **Mouthfeel**: The variety of feedback the journey of processing the food throigh the mouth produces.

It can be tempting to forego texture, mothfeel and aroma in search for endless flavour; and such path is easily walked to its conclusion but true artistry is making each of these __play off each other__, not having one factor reign supreme.

## Nutrition
Depending on the diet or lackthereof there might be a different _need_ or _reluctance_ for the following:
1. Macros
   1. Carbs
   2. Protein
   3. Fats
2. Minerals
   1. Zinc
   2. Iron
   3. Magnesium
   4. Calcium
3. Vitamins

## Convenience
It is not the same to spend two hours buying groceries for your sandwich than going to the cornerstore and having everything.
